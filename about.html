                <h1>TIME TO REDUCE YOUR WAITING TIME</h1>
                <P>Keeping the customers waiting in a long queue is not really the best idea<br> if you are aiming for a positive impact.<br>COVID-19 has highlighted the need for effective queue management and more than ever we know the importance of implementing this system in all kind of businesses. But how can it specifically contribute to a better customer experience?.<br>
                    Considering that the service is a key part to offer a good experience to customers, waiting time is an important factor not only for the purchase decision, but also for the probability of returning.

 

                    The less you wait, the better the customerâ€™s perception of service quality, increasing the chances of becoming loyal customers. On the other hand, even though the queues are part of the process, when realizing that the company is concerned with optimizing this operation, the customer already becomes more tolerant.
                    
                     
                    
                    In this sense, an efficient queue management can not only increase service efficiency, but also minimize the impacts of waiting on the overall consumer experience</P>
